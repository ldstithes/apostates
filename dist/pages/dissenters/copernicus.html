<h3>Nicolaus Copernicus</h3>
<img src="images/copernicus.jpg" alt="Nicolaus Copernicus">
<p>Nicolaus Copernicus was a mathematician and astronomer known for first suggesting heliocentrism, the concept that the Earth revolves around the Sun and not vice versa. While controversy was mild when
    Copernicus first published this model, it led to extreme distress among Catholic conventional wisdom when championed by later thinkers like Galileo.

<blockquote>
    <p>Finally we shall place the Sun himself at the center of the Universe. All this is suggested by the systematic procession of events and the harmony of the whole Universe, if only we face the facts, as they say, 'with both eyes open.'</p>
