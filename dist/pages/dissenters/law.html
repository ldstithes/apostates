<h3>William Law</h3>
<img src="images/law.jpg" alt="William Law">
<p>William Law served as a counselor to Mormon prophet Joseph Smith, but became disenchanted when Smith asked to take Law's wife in polyandrous marriage. The lone issue of the Nauvoo Expositor, published by Law, sparked
    the events that led to the assassination of Smith.

<blockquote>
    <p>The great mistake of my [life was my] having anything to do with Mormonism. I feel [it to] be a deep disgrace and never speak of it when I can avoid it; for over forty years I have been almost entirely silent on the subject.</p>
